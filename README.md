# OS-Fall-2020
Heya! Hope my notes can be of help. I don't take too in-depth notes since we have access to the slides, but I try to re-word what the prof says. I use an application called _Notion_ so just in terms of knowing what different things are...

Now, class notes aren't really "plagiarizable", but alongside the above _I often write notes in my own words so **PLEASE DO NOT COPY ANYTHING EXACTLY.**_ Since these are notes I doubt anyone would get in trouble, but it's both a) precautionary, and b) for your own good in terms of learning the material. Gratzi and hope they help!

## Naming
The name of my notes is **CLASS NAME WEEK NUM LECTURE NUM - TOPIC**. For example, "Operating Systems W2L1" is week 2 lecture 1, followed by whatever the topic is. Might match the syllabus, might not. 

## Toggles 
The little arrow thingies are toggles, and I often use those as recall when I'm reviewing notes. In other words, the notes there are either hiding images or, if they aks a question, are meant for you to guess what is below the toggle. Active recall gang lezgo

## Colors
If it's red, it's something I think is important. Yellow is similar, but moreso cool than important. Orange... both combined?

Blue and green are just "huh that's cool"

## Notes to Self
Sometimes I write notes to myself. Don't mind those :)
